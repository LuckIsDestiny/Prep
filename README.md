Angular Question-2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build an Angular application to check voting eligibility

Tasks:

1. Voting Eligibility: Create a component that asks the user to enter their age in a text box. If the age entered is 18 or above, display the message "eligible to vote," otherwise display "not eligible to vote."


2. Employee List: Using the Employee class created in the previous task, create an

Spring Security-1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement Spring Security to manage the access to your application


Problem Statement


Develop a Spring Boot application that configures Spring Security to manage the access to your application.



Tasks:


User Model and Repository: Create a User entity with fields:


1. id (type Long) : The unique id for the user.


2. username (type String) : The username for the user.


3. password (type String): The password for the user.


4. roles (type String): The user's role.



The role type should be set as a string as user can have role "USER" or "ADMIN".


Implement a UserRepository interface that extends JpaRepository to manage the CRUD operations for the User entity.


UserDetailsService Implementation:


Implement a service class named CustomUserDetailsService that implements UserDetailsService interface.


Override the loadUserByUsername method to load a user by its username.


Security Configuration:


Implement a configuration class named SecurityConfig that extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter.

Override the configure(HttpSecurity http) method to define the security rules.

Configure HTTP Basic authentication.

Configure in-memory authentication with at least two users (one with USER role and another with ADMIN role).

Controller Implementation:

Implement a controller named HomeController using the @RestController annotation.

Implement two endpoints:

GET /: This endpoint should be accessible to all authenticated users and return a "Welcome" message.

GET /admin: This endpoint should be accessible only to users with the ADMIN role and return a "Welcome Admin" message.

Test Cases:

Your implementation will be evaluated against the following criteria:

Basic Authentication: The application should prompt for a username and password when trying to access any endpoint.

User Access: A user with the USER role should be able to access the / endpoint but not the /admin endpoint.

Admin Access: A user with the ADMIN role should be able to access both the / and /admin endpoints.

You are not required to implement a front-end for this application. It is sufficient to create the back-end API and test it using a tool like Postman.

Spring CRUD-3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The government is building a centralized library management system which involves a micro-service, allowing people to issue books and return them at the right time.
 
Library management requires creating users and renewing user subscriptions via authenticated processes. Secure create-user and renew-user-subscription APIs with Spring Security. The API issue-book should be permitted for everyone. This micro-service should be built using the Spring Boot REST API framework and it should connect to the database using the JPA API and secure methods using Spring Security.
 
In this task, implement three APIs for which the details are given below:
 
  /api/v1/create-user [POST]: Simple user save method in an authenticated manner
  /api/v1/issue-book [POST]: Send issue, check if users subscribed(see subscribed field in User entity), otherwise throw SubscriptionExpiredException- permitAll
/api/v1/renew-user-subscription/{id} [GET]: Send userId, set user subscription to true in an authenticated manner.
 
Your task is to complete the files given below:
 
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/controller/LibraryController.java
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/security/WebSecurityConfigurer.java
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/repository/UserRepository.java

You can find blank jpa repositories here:
 
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/repository/UserRepository.java
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/repository/IssueRepository.java
 
Notes:
Implementation related specifics are added directly as javadocs in the workspace.
Ensure that the structure and datatypes of the APIs are followed as specified in the comments to ensure that the code is evaluated correctly.

Magic Button String Search
You are given two strings:

A string S of length N

A string T of length M

You also have a magic button. When you press this magic button, the last character of string S is removed and placed at the beginning of the string. You may press this button N times, and after each press (including the initial string), you:

Search for all occurrences of string T as a substring in the current version of S.

For each occurrence, record the starting index of T in S.

Add up all those starting indices to a running total.

After pressing the button N times, output the sum of all recorded indices modulo 10^9 + 7.

ð¢ Input
A string S of length N (1 â¤ N â¤ 10^4)

A string T of length M (1 â¤ M â¤ N)

ð Output
A single integer: the sum of starting indices of all T occurrences in each rotated version of S, modulo 10^9 + 7.

ð Example
text
Copy
Edit
Input:
S = "abcabc"
T = "abc"

Output:
14
Explanation:
Each rotation of S:

"abcabc" â T found at 0 and 3 â indices sum = 0 + 3 = 3

"cabcab" â T at 1 â sum = 1

"bcabca" â T at 3 â sum = 3

"abcabc" â same as step 1 â sum = 3

"cabcab" â same as step 2 â sum = 1

"bcabca" â same as step 3 â sum = 3

Final answer = 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 14

Project descriptions

The government is building a centralized library management system which involves a micro-service, allowing people to issue books and return them at the right time.

In this task, you need to conform to the following requirements:

1. Build "depositBook" API in a reactive way(should return Mono).

2. Users can issue a book and deposit them. If they issue the book after the given period, fine should apply.

3. You can find the fields and do the math(issueDate, period, returnDate). This micro-service should be built using the Spring Boot REST API framework and connect to the database using the JPA API.

4. "depositBook" API should be built using the Spring Boot WebFlux.

The application exposes 2 more APIs. The detalls of the APIs are given below:

1./api/v1/issueBook [POST]: Users issue a book of their choice, If book quantity is zero, It should throw the exception "BookNot AvailableException".

2./api/VI/depositBook [POST]: Send issue, return fine if there is one or return 0 (this one should be reactive)

Your task is to complete the file
